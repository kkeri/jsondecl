## parser

- unescape string literals

## model


## compiler

- dynamic cardinality

## optimization

- eliminate simple renamings
- what about circular references?

## to be decided

- what is the default cardinality for property patterns : 1 or +?
- what is the default mode on file testing: allow repeated property names?

## perspectives

- uniqueness (sets)
- default value for absent properties
- arithmetic expressions and constraints
- compilation to javascript

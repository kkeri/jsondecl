## parser

- unescape string literals
- make export an optional modifier for declarations
- imports and automatic default export anywhere in the file

## model


## compiler

- look up names also in embedding contexts
- dynamic cardinality

## optimization

- eliminate simple renamings

## to be decided

- which is the default for object patterns: closed or open?
- what is the default cardinality for property patterns : 1 or +?
- what is the default mode on file testing: allow repeated property names?

## perspectives

- uniqueness (sets)
- default value for absent properties
- arithmetic expressions and constraints
- compilation to javascript
